It runs under the Operating System (OS) Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa).\nWhen do you need to use Rossinante?\n\nYou need to analyse large datasets (RAM operations), and/or,\nYou need to repeat tasks many times (parallelization on CPU/GPU).\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Hardware specifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware\nSpecifications\n\n\n\n\nCPU\n80 threads (2 x Intel Xeon Gold 5218R)\n\n\nRAM\n384 GB (12 x Cells 32 Go RDIMM)\n\n\nGPU\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000\n\n\nInternal storage\n6 TB (8 x 960 GB SSD SATA)\n\n\nExternal storage (Seagate)\n8 TB (1 x 8 To HDD USB 3.0 5900 tr/min)\n\n\nExternal storage (Cervantes)\n8 TB (1 x 8 To HDD USB 3.0 5900 tr/min)\n\n\nExternal storage (Sancho)\n8 TB (1 x 8 To HDD USB 3.0 5900 tr/min)\n\n\n\n\nYou can run programs implemented in R, Python, Julia, Shell script, C, C++, etc. directly from a terminal or using Web clients like RStudio Server or Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNo job scheduling system (e.g. SLURM, Torque) has been installed. This means that you can launch jobs whenever you want.

Regular user, like you, has limited permissions.\nFor instance, you have only access to a personal directory: /home/you/. If you ask you can also have a personal space in one or more external drives (e.g. /media/cervantes/you).\nIf you need to use a non-installed software, please contact the administrator. Note that each user has a personal R library in which he/she can install every R packages he/she wants (independently of other users). For Python, packages are shared among all users (except if you work with virtual environments [recommended]).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRossinante is not a storage server. Its limited storage is shared among all users. You can store large dataset to run yours analyses, but once you’ve finished, please remove these files."

    "text": "2.3 Generating SSH keys\nSSH keys are a more secure method of logging into a remote server, because they are not vulnerable to common brute-force password hacking attacks. Generating an SSH keys pair consists in creating two long strings of characters: a public and a private key. You can place the public key on any server, and then connect to the server using a device that has access to the private key.\nLet’s create a new SSH keys pair using the cryptosystem ed25519. You will create this SSH keys pair locally (i.e. on your laptop).\n# Create a new SSH key pair (on your laptop) ----\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_rossinante -C \"jane.doe@mail.com\"\nIf you want, you can add a passphrase to increase the security of your key pair but each time you will connect to Rossinante you will be asked to enter it. It’s up to you.\nThis SSH keys pair has been stored in ~/.ssh/ under the name id_rossinante.\n# Content of the ~/.ssh/ folder ----\nls ~/.ssh\n## config       id_rossinante       id_rossinante.pub\nThe private key is id_rossinante and the public one id_rossinante.pub. Nobody (except you) can have access to the private key. So you need to change the permissions of this file:\n# Change private key permissions ----\n# (only Jane can only read this file)\nchmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rossinante\nAs we set a custom key file name (id_rossinante instead of id_ed25519), we will store this file name in the ~/.ssh/config file:\n# Add an entry in the config file ----\necho \"    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rossinante\" >> ~/.ssh/config\nThe SSH public key can be deployed everywhere. In our case, we must store it on the Rossinante server.\n# Create the folder ~/.ssh on Rossinante ----\n# (here we send a command via SSH without keeping the connection open)\nssh rossinante 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh'\n\n# Copying the public key to Rossinante ----\nscp ~/.ssh/id_rossinante.pub rossinante:~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nNow we can connect to Rossinante more securely and without entering any password (except if you have added a passphrase to your SSH keys pair).\n# SSH connection using SSH keys ----\nssh rossinante\nOur SSH public key on Rossinante has been stored under the name authorized_keys.\n# Content of the ~/.ssh folder (on Rossinante) ----\nls ~/.ssh\n## authorized_keys\nNB – If you lose you private key you will still be able to log in with your password."

This method consists in creating an encrypted SSH connection between a client (your laptop) and a server (Rossinante) through which a service (Rstudio Server) port (8787) can be relayed.\nTo create an SSH port forwarding, pass the -L option to the ssh client:\n.. code-block:: shell\n# Open an SSH port forwarding —- jane@laptop:~$ ssh -L 8787:localhost:8787 rossinante\nNB – The first 8787 is your local port through RStudio Server will be relayed. The second 8787 is the port on Rossinante through RStudio Server is running. In short, localhost is your laptop. Instead of localhost we could have written 127.0.0.1. You can change the first 8787 for any number greater than 1024.\nYou are now connected to Rossinante.\nTo start the RStudio Server interface, open a web browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.) and enter the following URL: localhost:8787.\nAfter entering your Rossinante log in information, you are connected to a new RStudio Server instance. You can now use this interface as the one you know (RStudio Desktop).\nImportant – RStudio Server has two buttons to close the interface: Sign out (B in Figure 5) and Quit current R session (C in Figure 5). If you click on Sign out, your session will be still active (in background) and you will have access to objects when you will log in again. You need to click on that button if you have launched time consuming analysis. If you click on Quit current R session you will stop all analyses and you were not able to access R objects. Click on that button to terminate your session.\nWarning – If you stop your SSH (port forwarding) session, you will close the RStudio Server session. Before shutting down the SSH connection, click on Sign out or Quit current R session to securely close the RStudio Server instance.\nTrick – If you have been disconnected from RStudio Server (network crash, power failure, etc.), you may not be able to restart RStudio Server (blank page). In that case, you need to kill your previous R sessions (still active) as follow:\n.. code-block:: shell\n# SSH connection to Rossinante —- jane@laptop:~$ ssh rossinante\n# Erase all active R sessions —- jdoe@rossinante:~$ killall -u jdoe rsession\n# Hardcore method —- jdoe@rossinante:~$ rm -rf ~/.local/share/rstudio/sessions/active/session-*"

These tools open virtual terminals (screens) in the main terminal and you can navigate between screens and the main terminal. The idea is to create (attach) a new screen, launch your analysis, go back to the main terminal (detach), and work on other stuffs. If you stop your SSH connection, the analysis is still running, and if you make a new SSH connection to Rossinante, you can reattach the screen and resume your R session.\nLet’s take an example with screen:\n.. code-block:: shell\n# SSH connection to Rossinante —- jane@laptop:~$ ssh rossinante\n# Attach (create) a new screen (named ‘r_analysis’, for instance) —- jdoe@rossinante:~$ screen -S r_analysis\n# Open R console (in the new screen) —- (r_analysis) jdoe@rossinante:~$ R\n# Launch the analysis —- (r_analysis) > source(“script_analysis.R”)\nTo detach from the screen session, type CTRL + A and D.\nYou can list running screens as follow:\n.. code-block:: shell\n# List running screens —- jdoe@rossinante:~$ screen -ls ## There is a screen on: ## 4002.r_analysis (Detached)\nTo reattach a screen session, use the following command:\n.. code-block:: shell\n# Reattach a screen —- jdoe@rossinante:~$ screen -r r_analysis\n(r_analysis) jdoe@rossinante:~$\nTo close a screen, type exit in the screen or press CTRL + A and K.\nMore information on screen: https://www.malekal.com/screen-linux-lancer-plusieurs-commandes-sans-perdre-execution/"
