## Good practices {#sec-good-practices}


One rule: **BE ALTRUISTIC**

1. Always ask others if you can use the server. Post a message on the Slack 
Channel `#rossinante` and explain your needs.
2. Do not use all available cores. 
3. Do not use all available memory.
4. Do not use RStudio Server to run time consuming analyses. Prefer using the 
command `screen` (see @sec-r-in-a-screen).
5. Rossinante is **NOT A STORAGE SERVER**. Remove your large datasets if you do 
not need them anymore.
