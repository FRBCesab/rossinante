## Good practices {#sec-good-practices}


One rule: **BE ALTRUISTIC**

1. Always ask others if you can use the server. Post a message on the Slack 
Channel `#rossinante` and explain your needs.
2. Do not use all available cores. 
3. Do not use Rossinante for developing code (except for small fixes). Write 
your code on your laptop and only use Rossinante to run analyses.
4. Do not use RStudio Server to run time consuming analyses. Prefer using the 
command `screen`.
5. Rossinante is **NOT A STORAGE SERVER**. Remove your large dataset if you do 
not need them anymore.
6. Store your large dataset in the external drives (e.g. `/media/seagate/jdoe/`).
