# Working with R


To execute R code on Rossinante, you can use either the RStudio Server interface
or directly the R console in the terminal. You can also use the `Rscript` command.


## RStudio Server


![RStudio Server interface](../images/rstudio-server.png){#fig-rstudio fig-align="center" width=100%}


To open the RStudio Server interface, you first need to create an **SSH tunneling** (or port forwarding). This method consists in creating an encrypted
SSH connection between a client (your laptop) and a server (Rossinante) through
which a service (Rstudio Server) port (8787) can be relayed.

To create an SSH port forwarding, pass the `-L` option to the ssh client:

```bash
# Start an SSH port forwarding ----
ssh -L 8787:localhost:8787 rossinante
```

The first `8787` is your local port through RStudio Server will be relayed.
The second `8787` is the port on Rossinante through RStudio Server is running.
In short, `localhost` is your laptop. Instead of `localhost` you could have
written `127.0.0.1`. You can change the first `8787` for any number greater
than `1024`.


You are now connected to Rossinante.


To start the RStudio Server interface, open a web browser (Firefox, Chrome,
etc.) and enter the following URL: <http://localhost:8787>.

After entering your Rossinante log in information, you are connected to a
new RStudio Server instance. You can now use this interface as the one you
know (RStudio Desktop).

RStudio Server has two buttons to close the interface:
`Sign out` (B in @fig-rstudio) and `Quit current R session` (C in @fig-rstudio).
If you click on `Sign out`, your session will be still active (in background)
and you will have access to objects when you will log in again. You need to
click on that button if you have launched time consuming analysis. If you click
on `Quit current R session` you will stop all analyses and you were not able
to access R objects. Click on that button to terminate your session.

## Warning

If you stop your SSH (port forwarding) session, you will close the
RStudio Server session. Before shutting down the SSH connection, click on
`Sign out` or `Quit current R session` to securely close the RStudio Server
instance.

## Trick

If you have been disconnected from RStudio Server (network crash, power failure, etc.), you may not be able to restart RStudio Server (blank page). In that case,
you need to kill your previous R sessions (still active) as follow:

```bash
# SSH connection to Rossinante ----
ssh rossinante

# Erase all active R sessions ----
killall -u jdoe rsession

# Hardcore method ----
rm -rf ~/.local/share/rstudio/sessions/active/session-*
```

## R in the terminal

An alternative is to launch the R console directly from the terminal of Rossinante.
And this is very easy.


```bash
# SSH connection to Rossinante ----
ssh rossinante

# Launch R console from terminal ----
R

## The Rscript command

If you want, you can also use the command `Rscript` to run an R script (or an 
R expression) without opening the R console, directly from the terminal.


```bash
# Run an R expression (option '-e') ----
Rscript -e 'print("El ingenioso Hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha")'
## [1] "El ingenioso Hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha"

# Write an R script on the personal folder ----
echo 'print("El ingenioso Hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha")' > ~/quijote.R

# Print 'quijote.R' file content ----
cat ~/quijote.R
## print("El ingenioso Hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha")

# Run the R script ----
Rscript ~/quijote.R
## [1] "El ingenioso Hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha"

# Remove the R script ----
rm ~/quijote.R
```

## R in a screen

If you launch R in the terminal (or `Rscript`) and your code takes time to
be computed, you cannot use the terminal until the computation is done. The job
is running in foreground. Moreover, if your SSH connection is stopped, your R
session is aborted and your work is lost.


The solution is to use a terminal multiplexer like `screen` or `tmux`. These tools
open *virtual* terminals (screens) in the main terminal and you can navigate
between screens and the main terminal. The idea is to create (attach) a new
screen, launch your analysis, go back to the main terminal (detach), and work
on other stuffs. If you stop your SSH connection, the analysis is still
running, and if you make a new SSH connection to Rossinante, you can reattach
the screen and resume your R session.



Let's take an example with `screen`:



```bash
# SSH connection to Rossinante ----
ssh rossinante

# Attach (create) a new screen (named 'r_analysis', for instance) ----
screen -S r_analysis

# Open R console (in the new screen) ----
R

# Launch the analysis ----
source("script_analysis.R")
```


To detach from the screen session, type `CTRL + A` and `D`.

You can list running screens as follow:



```bash
# List running screens ----
screen -ls
## There is a screen on:
##         4002.r_analysis (Detached)
```


To reattach a screen session, use the following command:


```bash
# Reattach a screen ----
screen -r r_analysis
```


To close a screen, type `exit` in the screen or press `CTRL + A` and `K`.



## R packages


Only base R packages are installed and shared among users.
Each user has a personal R library in which he can install/update every R packages he
wants (independently of other users). This library is located in
`~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2/`.

To install a new R package, use the interface of RStudio Server or the R console and run:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("sf")
```

If you want you can also update your packages:

```{r}
#| eval: false
update.packages()
```

**NB --** Some R packages require system libraries and some of them may be
missing on Rossinante. Please contact the administrator to solve the issue.
