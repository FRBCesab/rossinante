# Introduction


The FRB-CESAB server **Rossinante** is dedicated to *medium* performance 
scientific computing (see @tbl-hardware for hardware specification). 
It runs under the Operating System (OS) **Debian 12** (Bookworm).


**When do you want to use Rossinante?**

- You need to analyse large datasets (RAM operations) and/or,
- You need to repeat tasks many times (parallelization on CPU/GPU).

: Hardware specifications {#tbl-hardware}


You can run programs implemented in R, Python, Julia, Shell script, C, C++, etc. 
directly from a terminal or using Web clients like [RStudio Server](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200552306-Getting-Started) or 
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

## Important

No job scheduling system (e.g. SLURM, Torque) has been installed. This means 
that you can launch jobs whenever you want. However you are invited to read 
@sec-good-practices (Good practices).

**Can you do everything you want on Rossinante?**

No!

Rossinante has only **one administrator**. Regular user,
like you, has limited permissions.

You have access to four personal directories:

- `/home/you/`
- `/media/sancho/you` (external drive)
- `/media/seagate/you` (external drive)
- `/media/cervantes/you` (external drive)


If you need to use a non-installed software, please contact the administrator.
Note that each user has a personal R library in which he/she can install every
R packages he/she wants (independently of other users). For Python, packages are
shared among all users (except if you work with virtual environments **[recommended]**).

## Important

Rossinante is **not a storage server**. Its limited storage is shared
among all users. You can store large dataset to run yours
analyses, but once you've finished, please remove these files.

**There is no backup system!**. You are responsible for your data.
