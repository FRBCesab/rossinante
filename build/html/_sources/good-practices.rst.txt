Please follow these rules:

1. Always ask others if you can use the server. Post a message on the Slack Channel ``#rossinante`` and wait for responses.
2. Do not use Rossinante for developping code (except for small fixes). Write your code on your laptop and only use Rossinante to run analyses.
3. Do not use RStudio Server to run time consuming analyses. Prefer using the command ``screen``.
4. Rossinante is **NOT A STORAGE SERVER**. Remove your large datasets if you do not need them anymore.
5. Store your large datasets in the external drive ``/media/seagate/jdoe/``.
6. You are allow to store 600GB in your personal directory (``/home/jdoe/``) and 800GB on the external drive (``/media/seagate/jdoe``).

**If you do not respect these rules the administrator will act accordingly (temporary ban).**

|

**Important:** Rossinante will be automatically rebooted the 15th of each month. Please plan your analyses accordingly.
